A bot that can automatically purchase champions using tesseract for TFT.

Features:

Auto buy

Showing strong charm when appear from market

Manual Pool Tracker


----------------INSTALLATION--------------------

First, you need to download Tesseract -> https://github.com/UB-Mannheim/tesseract/wiki/ After installing Tesseract, you should add it to the Windows Path (otherwise it won't work).

Then, you should download the necessary libraries from the requirements.txt file -> pip install requirements.txt

I will not create an exe file; you can build it yourself with VSCode.

Also, if you want to add other champions or if an update comes and I don't update the project, you can easily make adjustments to the code yourself.

------------------------------------

TO DO

Show S+ S A tier Augments.

Transition the Pool Tracker section from manual to automatic (if anyone can help, I'm open to help; I don't know how to find pointers in TFT).

Create a structure that automatically suggests the strongest compositions with the champions on the board or based on that patch using AI assistance (hard asf).
